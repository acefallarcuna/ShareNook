 ## Getting Started

ShareNook is your community's go-to platform for sharing resources and promoting sustainable consumption. Whether you're in need of a tool for a DIY project, looking for a book to read, or seeking to borrow household items, ShareNook connects you with fellow community members willing to share. Our intuitive interface, powered by the Google Maps API, allows you to easily find nearby resources available for sharing. Simply browse through the listings, explore what's available in your area, and connect with other users to arrange the exchange process. By participating in ShareNook, you not only gain access to the resources you need but also contribute to a more sustainable future. By sharing items instead of buying new ones, you help reduce waste and promote responsible consumption, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 12.
